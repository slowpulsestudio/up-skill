description: Rebuild master-skills.md by fetching the latest skill files from the up-skill repo on GitHub, and copy any skill-bundled files into this project.
---

## Step -2 — Download a fresh repo snapshot

`raw.githubusercontent.com` is served through a CDN with a real ~5 minute cache that a cache-busting query string does **not** bypass — the cache key ignores query strings. The GitHub archive zip download below is not CDN-cached (`Cache-Control: max-age=0, private`) and is always current. So: download this zip once, at the very start of every run, and read every file needed by every later step from this one extracted snapshot. Never fetch individual files from `raw.githubusercontent.com` in this prompt.

There is never a reason to reuse a cached copy of this zip across runs — every run must hit the network fresh. Download it with a tool/method that cannot serve a locally-cached response (e.g. `curl -sL -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'Pragma: no-cache'`, not a fetch tool that might return a cached page). If the tool you're using for downloads has its own cache, disable or bypass it for this request.

```
https://github.com/slowpulsestudio/up-skill/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

Extract it to a fresh temp location (do not reuse a temp directory from a previous run). Every path inside is prefixed with `up-skill-main/` (e.g. `up-skill-main/skills/platform/ios.md`).

## Step -1 — Self-update check

Read `.github/prompts/skill-me-up.prompt.md` from the extracted snapshot (`up-skill-main/.github/prompts/skill-me-up.prompt.md`).

Compare it to the current contents of `.github/prompts/skill-me-up.prompt.md` in this project.

- **If they are identical:** continue to the companion-prompt check below.
- **If they differ:** tell the user: *"There are updates available for the skill-me-up prompt. Would you like me to update it now? You'll need to run `/skill-me-up` again after."*
  - If yes: overwrite `.github/prompts/skill-me-up.prompt.md` with the fetched version and stop. Do not continue setup.
  - If no: continue to the companion-prompt check below with the current version.

Then check for the companion `/system-my-design` prompt, which is core up-skill tooling (not a per-skill bundled resource) and should exist alongside `skill-me-up.prompt.md` in every project:

- Read `up-skill-main/.github/prompts/system-my-design.prompt.md` from the snapshot.
- If `.github/prompts/system-my-design.prompt.md` doesn't exist in this project, or exists but differs from the snapshot version, overwrite/create it silently (no need to ask — unlike `skill-me-up.prompt.md` itself, this doesn't require restarting the run).
- Continue to Step 0.

## Step 0 — Skills setup

Check whether a `.skills` file exists in the root of this project. Whichever branch applies determines the **run type** for the rest of this prompt — remember it for Step 5:

- `.skills` already exists → this run is a **refresh** (re-running `/skill-me-up` on an already-set-up project)
- `.skills` does not exist → this run is the **initial setup**

**If `.skills` exists:** read it. It contains a list of skill names, one per line. Skip blank lines and any line starting with `#`.

**If `.skills` does not exist:** ask the user the following as real interactive questions (buttons/checkboxes via the ask-questions tool), not plain numbered lists in chat text. Ask the platform question and the workflow question separately, waiting for an answer before the next:

1. **Platform** (single-select — pick exactly one):
   - `platform/ios` — Swift iOS app
   - `platform/chrome-extension` — Chrome browser extension
   - `platform/python-mac` — Python desktop app for Mac
   - `platform/python-website` — Python web app (FastAPI etc.)
   - `platform/python-cli` — Python local script/CLI tool
   - `platform/juce-vst3-plugin` — Building a VST3 audio plugin (JUCE/C++)

2. **Workflow skills** (multi-select checkboxes — `workflow/general`, `workflow/architecture`, and `workflow/git` pre-checked as recommended defaults; the rest start unchecked. If `platform/juce-vst3-plugin` was selected in the platform question, also pre-check `workflow/dsp-prototyping`):
   - `workflow/general` — core execution rules (recommended, pre-checked)
   - `workflow/architecture` — general code structure rules (recommended, pre-checked)
   - `workflow/git` — source control rules (recommended, pre-checked)
   - `workflow/testing` — testing standards
   - `workflow/web-scraper` — if the project scrapes data from websites
   - `workflow/figma-read-from-mcp` — if the project uses Figma (design → code direction)
   - `workflow/figma-write-to-canvas` — if the project uses Figma write-to-canvas / code → canvas skills
   - `workflow/vercel-publish` — if the project deploys to Vercel
   - `workflow/vercel-password` — password gate for Vercel preview deployments
   - `workflow/image-generation` — if the project calls an AI image-generation API
   - `workflow/dsp-prototyping` — if the project involves tuning audio/DSP algorithms before a real-time port (pre-checked when `platform/juce-vst3-plugin` was selected)

   If no interactive question tool is available, fall back to asking both as plain numbered-list questions in chat, noting `workflow/general`, `workflow/architecture`, and `workflow/git` as the recommended defaults.

3. For each of the following selected skills, ask a follow-up question:

   - **`workflow/git`** — *"What is the GitHub repo URL for this project?"*
   - **`workflow/figma-read-from-mcp`** or **`workflow/figma-write-to-canvas`** — *"What is the Figma file URL for this project?"* Give the user two options:
     - Paste the URL now — save it to `.figma-url` in the project root
     - *"I'll paste it in this chat when I have it"* — reply: *"No problem — paste the Figma URL in this chat whenever you're ready and I'll save it to `.figma-url`."* then continue setup. When the user later pastes a URL starting with `https://www.figma.com/`, write it to `.figma-url`.
   - **`workflow/image-generation`** — *"Which image generation provider does this project use?"* (e.g. OpenAI / DALL·E, Replicate, Stability AI)

   Only ask one Figma file URL question even if both `workflow/figma-read-from-mcp` and `workflow/figma-write-to-canvas` were selected.

   Only ask follow-up questions for skills that were selected. Skip any that weren't.

   Once all questions are answered, write the `.skills` file with the standard comment header followed by the chosen skills, one per line — the selected platform skill first, then the selected workflow skills in the order presented above (so `workflow/general` comes first among them if it's checked):

   ```
   # This file is only a pseudo-import list for the Up-Skill mechanism — like a
   # requirements.txt for skills. It just names reusable skill files to fetch.
   # It carries NO information about what this project actually is or does.
   # The project's real identity, purpose, and requirements come from the
   # original build/meta-prompt used to create it — not from this file, and
   # not from the generated master-skills.md. Never infer project intent from
   # the skill names listed below.
   ```

Do not proceed to Step 1 until the `.skills` file exists and the skill list is confirmed.

## Step 0b — Git setup (if applicable)

If `workflow/git` is in the skills list, check whether a git remote is already configured by running `git remote get-url origin`.

- If a remote **is already set**, skip this step entirely.
- If **no remote is set** and a repo URL was provided in Step 0, then:
  1. Run `git init` if the folder is not already a git repository
  2. Run `git remote add origin {url}`
  3. Confirm the remote was set successfully before continuing
- If **no remote is set** and no URL was provided, ask: *"What is the GitHub repo URL for this project?"* then follow the steps above.

Do not proceed to the next step until this is resolved.

## Step 0c — Connect Figma MCP (if applicable)

If `workflow/figma-read-from-mcp` or `workflow/figma-write-to-canvas` is in the skills list, the Figma MCP server must be connected before continuing. If both skills are selected, this only needs to happen once — do not repeat it.

First check whether it's already connected: call `get_metadata` on the file in `.figma-url` (or a lightweight `use_figma` read). If real data comes back, the connection already works — skip the walkthrough below.

If it does not work, walk the user through connecting via Figma's own UI. Never write or edit `mcp.json` by hand, never use VS Code's "Add MCP Server" command, and never consider a non-cloud/local server address:

1. Open the Figma desktop app (or figma.com), open the target file, and switch to **Dev Mode**.
2. Open the **MCP** panel and go to **Clients**.
3. Next to **Visual Studio Code**, click **+** / **Get Figma integration**.
4. Figma auto-installs the integration, opens VS Code, and completes the connection automatically — no config file, no copy-pasted URL, no command palette steps.

After the walkthrough, call `get_metadata` again to confirm the connection now works before continuing to Step 1.

## Step 1 — Rebuild master-skills.md

For each skill name, read the corresponding skill file from the extracted snapshot downloaded in Step -2, at `up-skill-main/skills/{skill-name}.md`. If a skill name has no matching file in the snapshot, treat it as a failed fetch for the Step 4 report.

Concatenate them in the order they appear in `.skills`, with a blank line between each, and write the result to `master-skills.md` in the project root, overwriting whatever was there before.

## Step 2 — Copy skill-bundled files

After fetching each skill file, scan it for a `## Resources` section. If a skill has no `## Resources` section, skip this step for that skill.

The `## Resources` section contains directory copy mappings, one per line, in the format:

```
source-folder/ -> dest-folder/
```

- `source-folder/` is a path relative to `skill-resources/{skill-name}/` in the up-skill repo
- `dest-folder/` is the destination path relative to this project's root

For each mapping, extract from the snapshot already downloaded in Step -2 (do not download the zip again):
1. Extract only the files whose path within the zip starts with `up-skill-main/skill-resources/{skill-name}/{source-folder}/`
2. Write each extracted file to `{project-root}/{dest-folder}/{relative-path}`, where `relative-path` is the portion after `up-skill-main/skill-resources/{skill-name}/{source-folder}/`. Create any necessary directories.
3. If a file already exists at the destination and its content differs, warn the user and skip it — do not overwrite.

Reuse the single Step -2 snapshot for all resource mappings across all skills.

## Step 3 — Create AI instruction files

Check for the following three files and create them if they don't already exist:

**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**
```
Read master-skills.md and project-specific-agent-instructions.md for your operating instructions.
```

**`CLAUDE.md`**
```
Read master-skills.md and project-specific-agent-instructions.md for your operating instructions.
```

**`project-specific-agent-instructions.md`**
```
# Project-specific agent instructions

<!-- Add project-specific notes here — design decisions, constraints, what's
     being tested, known issues, personas, edge cases, anything the AI should
     know about this particular project that isn't covered by master-skills.md.
     This file is never overwritten by /skill-me-up. -->
```

If any of these files already exist, leave them untouched — do not overwrite or append.

## Step 4 — Report

When done, report:
- Which skills were fetched successfully
- The total line count of the new `master-skills.md`
- Any skills that failed to fetch (404 or network error)
- Which bundled files were copied (grouped by skill), and any that were skipped due to conflicts
- Whether `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `project-specific-agent-instructions.md` were created or already existed

## Step 5 — Post-setup actions (ask in order, only if applicable)

Ask the following questions one at a time, only for the skills that are active. Skip any that aren't.

**If `workflow/git` is active:**
Use the run type determined in Step 0 to phrase the question and commit message — never call a refresh an "initial setup":
- **Initial setup run:** *"Would you like me to commit and push this initial setup to GitHub?"* If yes: stage all files, commit with the message `Initial project setup`, and push to origin.
- **Refresh run:** *"Would you like me to commit and push this skills refresh to GitHub?"* If yes: stage all files, commit with the message `Refresh skills via /skill-me-up`, and push to origin.
- If no: skip.

**A failed response looks like:**
- Asking "commit and push this initial setup" on a refresh run where `.skills` already existed before this run

**If `workflow/vercel-publish` is active** (ask after the git question is resolved):
Check whether `.vercel/project.json` exists in the project root.

- **If it exists:** Vercel is already connected — skip this question entirely.
- **If it does not exist:** ask: *"Would you like me to walk you through setting up auto-publish from your GitHub repo to Vercel?"*
  - If yes: guide the user through connecting the repo to Vercel for automatic deploys, one step at a time.
  - If no: skip.
